          <p>Rotom (ロトム) is a dual Electric-/Ghost-type Pokemon introduced in the 4th generation of pokemon.</p>

          <p>While it is not known to evolve, it does have multiple other forms it can take by controlling appliances, 5 of which change Rotom's type.</p>

        <p>
          Rotom is a small, orange Pokémon that has a body of plasma. 
          It is mostly spherical, with a bulb below its body and a long 
          pointed protrusion on top, making it shaped like a lightning rod. 
          There is a whitish blue aura of electricity around it that forms 
          lightning bolt-shaped appendages. It has teeth, and its unique, 
          blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, 
          Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked 
          in the process. According to the Rotom Catalog, Rotom in its base 
          form is possessing a light bulb. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Rotom has the ability to enter and control appliances. Rotom 
          typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the 
          household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people,
          as seen in the anime. Despite this, some Rotom have taken to 
          inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The Rotom 
          Pokédex, Rotom Phones, Rotomi, Rotom Bike, and Drone Rotom are some 
          examples. The creation of Rotom Pokédex in particular was inspired 
          by Mow Rotom. Some of these particular forms allow Rotom to speak 
          human languages. These forms show that Rotom is also highly intelligent. 
          As also shown in the anime, Rotom has the ability to time travel. 
          Rotom tends to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues 
          on Rotom and its ability to power unique motors.

          Honestly I just wanted some more stuff on

      <section class="rotomstats">
        <h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>

        <p>
          Rotom's base stats:
        </p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>HP</th>
              <th>Attack</th>
              <th>Defense</th>
              <th>Special Attack</th>
              <th>Special Defense</th>
              <th>Speed</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>50</td>
              <td>50</td>
              <td>77</td>
              <td>95</td>

              <td>91</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>When Rotom changes it's form, it's stats also change, as follows:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>HP</th>

              <th>Special Attack</th>
              <th>Special Defense</th>
              <th>Speed</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>50</td>
              <td>65</td>
              <td>107</td>
              <td>105</td>
              <td>107</td>

      <section class="rotomforms">
        <h2 id="forms">Forms</h2>

        <p>As stated previously, Rotom can take on many forms 
        depending on the appliance it's controlling. 5 of these
        forms change Rotom's stats and typing. The rest are just
        cosmetic. Well he basically has an unlimited amount of forms
        but since this is a game they kinda have a limit to what
        they can program. Am I getting off track?

            with a thing living in it. That you own.
            Does the Rotom want to be a phone?

            <p>
              Up until now you were under the assumption that 
              getting a Rotom would be as easy as just paying 
              for it. Well you'd be <b>DEAD WRONG.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              That's not the only thing that's dead, as you'll 
              be dead if you can't pass this <b>WORTHINESS TEST.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              And if you brought a #2 lead pencil, you already 
              lost <b>5 WORTHINESS POINTS</b> because this is not
              a handwritten test.
            </p>

            <label for="worthy">Tell us why you're <b>WORTHY</b> in the following text box:</label>

            <textarea id="worthy" name="worthy" cols="20" rows="5" required></textarea>
            
            <small>
              Note: Worthiness will not be determined immediately upon submission. 
              Please allow for up to 3 business months of time for worthiness 
              to be determined. If you are determined unworthy, you will die
              as soon as the decision is made. Best hope you make it, bud.
            </small>
            
            <!-- 
            I would like to note that <b> is supposed to be used for
            elements with special importance, and not intended for
            making text appear bold. 
            
            To make things properly bold involves CSS, and I don't 
            really want to look at that right now, so for just this 
            one purpose and never again, I'm going to incorrectly use it. 

            Basically, I know it's incorrect please don't kill me over it.
