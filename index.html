            <p>Rotom (ロトム) is a dual Electric-/Ghost-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV.</p>

            <p>While it is not known to evolve, it does have multiple other forms it can take by controlling appliances, 5 of which change Rotom's type.</p>

            <p>
              In Generation VII, Rotom can possess a special Pokédex and become the Rotom Pokédex, 
              which has the ability to speak human language. In Generation VIII and Generation IX, 
              Rotom can possess a smartphone that doubles as a Pokédex and become the Rotom Phone. 
              Rotom are also used in Rotomi terminals, Rotom Bikes, and Drone Rotom.

                Rotom is a small, orange Pokémon that has a body of plasma. 
                It is mostly spherical, with a bulb below its body and a long 
                pointed protrusion on top, making it shaped like a lightning rod. 
                There is a whitish blue aura of electricity around it that forms 
                lightning bolt-shaped appendages. It has teeth, and its unique, 
                blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, 
                Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked 
                in the process. According to the Rotom Catalog, Rotom in its base 
                form is possessing a light bulb. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Rotom has the ability to enter and control appliances. Rotom 
                typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the 
                household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people,
                as seen in the anime. Despite this, some Rotom have taken to 
                inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The Rotom 
                Pokédex, Rotom Phones, Rotomi, Rotom Bike, and Drone Rotom are some 
                examples. The creation of Rotom Pokédex in particular was inspired 
                by Mow Rotom. Some of these particular forms allow Rotom to speak 
                human languages. These forms show that Rotom is also highly intelligent. 
                As also shown in the anime, Rotom has the ability to time travel. 
                Rotom tends to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues 
                on Rotom and its ability to power unique motors.

          <p>As stated previously, Rotom can take on many forms 
          depending on the appliance it's controlling. 5 of these
          forms change Rotom's stats and typing. The rest are just
          cosmetic. Well he basically has an unlimited amount of forms
          but since this is a game they kinda have a limit to what
          they can program. Am I getting off track?

          <p>
            Greetings, loyal subjects! If you are as loyal as you claim, you will remember that the 
            previous iteration of this website had an "Order a Rotom" section.
          </p>

          <p>
            Turns out what we were doing was considered "illegal" and "unethical" by the "government". Along with paying an
            undisclosable amount in fines, we now have to create this newsletter on endangered Pokémon. 
          </p>

          <p>
            If you think we are going to create this newsletter, you are <span class="bold">DEAD WRONG</span>. Well, we are going to
            make it, but not about all the other <span class="bold">POINTLESS</span> Pokémon. It will be about the only one that matters, <span class="bold">ROTOM</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            So go ahead and sign up. While you're at it, sign up everyone you know. Sign up your friends, your family, your pets, your enemies. 
            Then start signing up people you don't know. Go steal email addresses and sign 'em up. Sign the whole damn world up.
